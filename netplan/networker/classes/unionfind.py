        Notes:
            Union-find data structure also known as a Disjoint-set data
            structure

            Each unionFind instance X maintains a family of disjoint sets of
            hashable objects.

            This is a modified version of the data structure presented in
            Networkx nx.utils, with additonal properites to support the
            modified Boruvkas algorithm. The original citations are listed
            below.
