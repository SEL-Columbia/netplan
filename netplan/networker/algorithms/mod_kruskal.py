    """
    algorithm to compute the euclidean minimum spanning forest of nodes in
    GeoGraph G with 'budget' based restrictions on edges

    Uses a modified version of Kruskal's algorithm

    NOTE:  subgraphs is modified as a side-effect...may remove in future
        (useful for testing right now)

    Args:
        G:  GeoGraph of nodes to be connected if appropriate
            Nodes should have 'budget' attribute

        subgraphs:  UnionFind data structure representing existing network's
            connected components AND the 'fake' nodes projected onto it.  This
            is the basis for the agglomerative nearest neighbor approach in
            this algorithm.

            NOTE:  ONLY the existing networks components are represented in
            the subgraphs argument.  The nodes in G will be added within
            this function

        rtree:  RTree based index of existing network

    Returns:
        GeoGraph: representing minimum spanning forest of G subject to the
            budget based restrictions
